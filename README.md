## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues:

1. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   sudo cat ~/.config/macosloginwatcher/error.log
   sudo cat ~/.config/macosloginwatcher/output.log
   ```

2. Verify the service is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep macosloginwatcher | grep -v grep
   ```
   Note: You should see two processes - the main daemon and a child process for message handling.

3. Check the LaunchDaemon status:
   ```bash
   sudo launchctl list | grep macosloginwatcher
   ```
   Note: Status 0 is normal - it means the daemon successfully started and spawned its child process.
